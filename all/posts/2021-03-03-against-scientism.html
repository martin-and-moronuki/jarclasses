      <h1>On Scientism</h1>
      <p>The other day I was making a cake with my younger son. We measured ingredients carefully into the bowl of the KitchenAid mixer, stopping periodically to scrape the bowl because this is a thing KitchenAid mixers are fairly bad at (it does feel blasphemous and ungrateful to say anything negative about the KitchenAid mixer, and yet!). When we got to the end and were pouring batter into the pan, we realized there was some amount of butter and sugar, from the first creaming step, still clinging to the bottom of the bowl, unmixed with the other ingredients. I wondered if we should scrape it out as we scraped the batter into the pan, mixing it in a little as the batter poured; the other alternatives seemed to be to ignore it or to take the batter back out of the cake pan and remix it to get it all in there.</p>
      <p>I did scrape it out and half-heartedly mix it into the batter as it was being poured, and thought, &quot;oh no, this is probably going to ruin the cake!&quot;</p>
      <p>But, you know? The cake turned out great. Days later, it is still moist and chocolatey with a very fine crumb. We are all very pleased with it.</p>
      <p>And I thought to myself, how often is there some imprecise, unknowable amount of an ingredient stuck to one or another of the implements along the way: to the measuring cups, to the mixer bowl and paddle, to the spoons, to the counter because you forgot to downshift the mixer speed before dumping in some flour. So, if there are all these imprecisions, why do so many food writers insist on writing as if measuring your flour to the ounce (or gram) is the single key to success in baking?</p>
      <p>Honestly, as much as it pains me to say this, this might be Alton Brown&#39;s fault. Because I think there is a certain type of food-love that invests recipes, even when they aren&#39;t this kind of scientistic recipe, with an authority that is unwarranted, and I think <span class="title">Good Eats</span> was one of the first popularizers of that cooking-as-science ideal.</p>
      <p>Granted, this kind of pretense at precision has not taken over the most mainstream recipe writing, the ones most home cooks are actually reading in search of ways to feed themselves or their families. I also think this is a relatively recent trend, at least in American recipes. For me, it is definitely true that Alton Brown is the first person I saw do this, despite that he clearly worships his grandma&#39;s biscuits and she doesn&#39;t even measure anything, but the whole <span class="title">Cook&#39;s Illustrated</span> crew might also have a lot to answer for. And, to be clear, I love Alton Brown and <span class="title">Good Eats</span> and Kenji Alt-Lopez and <span class="title">Serious Eats</span>, and <span class="title">Cook&#39;s Illustrated</span> and all of that. I have learned a lot from all these guys; I enjoy their writing, their recipes, and this sciencey approach to cooking.</p>
      <p>But I have two reasons for my irritation with this school of food writing and cookery. The first is that it&#39;s never more than a pretense of precision, because no home cook is cooking in a science lab or clean room. What can it mean to say your butter should be at &quot;room temperature,&quot; which might vary wildly, but your sugar must be measured out to the gram in the name of precision?</p>
      <p>The second is that I don&#39;t buy into the idea that recipes are or should be treated as authoritative; I don&#39;t buy into the need to standardize cooking.</p>
      <p>However, that isn&#39;t how I usually cook! I learn from these things and gradually incorporate them into my ways of thinking about cooking, but I am not a big precise-measurement or temperature-taking cook. I tend to be somewhat more careful about measuring in things where you won&#39;t be able to correct for it later (such as baking, Instant Pot cooking, or making meatloaf) than I am when I&#39;m cooking a pasta sauce on the stove and can keep tinkering all through its cooking process, but overall I&#39;ve been cooking for 35 years and I can usually tell by instinct and by feel and smell when a batter or dough looks right, so I don&#39;t worry about being very precise. Candy making is perhaps the biggest exception, although I still rely more on testing my candy in cold water than on a candy thermometer.</p>
      <p>As far as I can tell, most of the home cooks whose foods I have loved are the same.</p>
      <p>I remember reading some time ago how there&#39;s been a dropoff in amateur musicianship and communal singing (at least in America) as electronic recordings became widespread; over time, recorded and heavily produced music became ubiquitous, so that there is always music wherever you are. There are probably other factors, too, but these are some of them. Over time, there was less feeling that in order to have music you have to do it yourself, but also, superstars with professional musicians and producers can always make better music than you can, so doubly why bother? You can&#39;t compete with the professionals. And something has been lost, although we compensate here and there with karaoke nights or the recent sea shanty fad.</p>
      <p>I have this optimistic idea that <span class="emphatic">anyone can cook (and most people should)</span>, but it can&#39;t compete with professional cooks on the one hand and increasingly finicky recipes on the other -- the pretense at being absolutely precise being only one of the ways in which a recipe can be finicky. I recently acquired a cookbook called <span class="title">Modern Sourdough</span> and almost immediately feared that I will never cook from this book because its recipes are completely overbearing. Perhaps someday when I have nothing better to do.</p>
      <p>In Dan Barber&#39;s book <span class="title">The Third Plate</span>, the final section of the book is about modern wheat and grain farming and how industrial baking and the need for absolute consistency in bread baking and other processed foods made with grains requires highly standardized flours, which drives farmers to grow grains that will provide a very consistent amount of protein, for example. These wheats have not been bred for flavor or for nutrition; they&#39;ve been bred for consistency. They require chemical fertilizers and vastly more water than older, less consistent varieties do. So the whole system demands and conforms to industrial consistency. And flavors are lost, and drought-tolerant varieties are lost. So much is lost to the industrial food system.</p>
      <p>If you did need industrial-esque consistency in your home kitchen, then you might need to be very precise in your measurements and temperatures and, for pete&#39;s sake, make sure you scrape your mixer bowl thoroughly. But is this really what you need? Don&#39;t buy into the lies of Big Food that tell you your brownies must be absolutely precise or else they will be ruined! They might not come out perfectly consistent but you don&#39;t need them to because they will not be subjected to the rigors of machine slicing and packaging. And honestly most of the time you won&#39;t notice that they are not exactly the same as the last time you made them. Are they a little denser this time than last time? Maybe! Sometimes this happens! Are they *bad* because of it? Probably not! Sometimes you will even find that you like this version better than the last version, and a new version of the recipe will be born.</p>
      <p>In some ways, old recipes which are vague approximations of how you should cook a certain thing, often because it was expected that you were learning to cook at an experienced cook&#39;s side and receiving oral and manual instruction with a recipe as merely a reminder or nudge. So, the way we treat recipes now might in part be a reflection of the fact that we&#39;ve lost the oral culture aspect of cooking, the manual practice of cooking, and now we are a fully literate culture in which reference to the written word is the main way things are known.</p>
      <p>Some of these posts are hard to write because instead of being about one thing they are about everything: they are about the entire way I cook and how cooking is a part of a total worldview for me that I can&#39;t communicate unless I explain my entire worldview.</p>

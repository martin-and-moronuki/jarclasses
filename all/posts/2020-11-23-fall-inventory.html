      <h1>Fall Inventory, 2020</h1>
      <p>When our CSA ended this year, we took an inventory of some of the foods we have on hand. We're hoping that writing about it will help us in the future, giving us a reference point for planning and organizing next year. We're hoping that this will serve a couple of purposes. First, this helps us with meal and menu planning throughout the winter; we can plan to eat up the foods that we have and make sure none of the squash or parsnips goes to waste. Second, it will also help guide my choices in 2021 regarding how much food to buy and how much to preserve in different forms, based on how much of it we eat up over the course of the winter. This was partially prompted by the fact that during the last winter (2019-20) we ran out of a few items quite quickly. I remembered at least a couple of those things while I was putting food up this summer, and put up more of those things this year, but I'm curious to see if they last us through winter.</p>
      <h2>Food storage</h2>
      <p>Overall, we store a lot of food. We do this even in years when we don't have a hard winter or a pandemic to deal with, because even in mild winters there can be times when we don't want to leave our house -- someone's sick or it's snowy this weekend or we want to get some other project done instead. These times can be unpredictable, so I don't like for my meal planning to hinge at all on the accessibility of a grocery store. Honestly this is mostly true in summer, too, but summers are more predictable in this regard because, knowing we have a lot of food storage to do (canning, fermenting, and whatnot), we plan our weeks around visits to farmer's markets.</p>
      <p>We keep a chest freezer fairly well stocked with meats and cheeses and some yogurt (and occasionally milk, which gets weird when you freeze it but is still very acceptable to use in cooking, just weird for drinking). So that's part of our food storage.</p>
      <p>We also then have some quantity of prepper-adjacent food storage: a very large bin containing boxes of pasta, freeze-dried cheeses and fruits from <a href="https://www.thrivelife.com/invite/MjE5NTk4">Thrive Life</a>. The freeze-dried cheeses are particularly great, easy to reconstitute, and allow us to eat an optimal amount of pizza in the winter, even if we have not done a good job of stocking the freezer with fresh mozzarella and parmesan. These are mostly housed on shelves in the basement, where we also keep my home-canned food.</p>
      <p>Yes, we also have prepper quantities of toilet paper on hand, and believe me, we were very grateful for it a few times this year.</p>
      <p>We have a second chest freezer, a small one, in the kitchen. We mostly keep frozen vegetables, fruits, and whole grains in there. We have not really counted the vegetables and fruits that I froze last summer as part of this inventory, although that's something I'd like to do next year. Off the top of my head, though, we have a gallon ziploc each of frozen snow peas, asparagus, spinach (maybe two gallons of spinach), cauliflower, broccoli, and kale, plus two quarts of green beans, as well as several quarts of strawberries, cherries, blueberries, raspberries, and a couple pints of frozen roasted tomatoes with seasonings. I like to pull those tomatoes out and heat them very gently and put them on pasta for the freshest tasting pasta you can possibly have in winter.</p>
      <p>We also have a second refrigerator in the garage. Our garage is unheated and mostly uninsulated, so that fridge has to work kind of hard for about two months every year, and then in the winter it doesn't really come on at all, but its insulation does prevent the things stored in it from freezing. That refrigerator has a lot of fermented vegetables in it, along with the sundried tomatoes that I pack in oil, a large soppressata that we are gradually eating, some cheese, and, again, some whole grains. Well, it also has a bunch of <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/houghton/baking-emily-dickinsons-black-cake/">Emily Dickinson's fruit cakes</a> in it that my kids and I made while we were studying her poem <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/51610/it-sifts-from-leaden-sieves-291">"It sifts from Leaden Sieves"</a>; they are preserved with bourbon and seem to taste just as good now as they did a year ago. Every time I break another one out -- her recipe makes a lot! -- I think they will have finally gone bad, but no, they're still quite good.</p>
      <p>And finally, we have a "root cellar" where we keep fresh vegetable storage. It's a room in our basement where we cut off the heating and also leave one of the windows in that room slightly cracked to keep it very cool in there. This inventory mostly focuses on fresh vegetable storage, which is what we have stored in the root cellar.</p>
      <p>Ultimately I want to have notes as well about which items don't last in terms of staying fresh and edible throughout winter. Already I've been noticing that some pickles and some of our fresh storage aren't staying as fresh tasting as I'd hoped, so that will help me adjust quantities of what I make next summer. If something doesn't taste as good as we'd hoped, we do eat it up but we might make less next year so that we can finish eating it while it's still in peak condition. This seems to be true of a lot of the "half sours" and such that I made this summer, but they're still ok, just not as good as they were. We'll see how it goes as we get further into the winter.</p>
      <h2>The Inventory</h2>
      <p>We are a family of four, with two sons aged 15 and 11 at time of writing, so they're both sometimes going through rapid growth spurts where they eat a lot. We also have several herbivorous pets (rabbits, guinea pigs, an iguana) and some of the vegetables in storage will end up as feed for them, though they often eat the scraps from our dinner preparations (peels and the like).</p>
      <p>Since I do all of my meal planning from our food storage (rather than do what I think is more the typical thing where you think of foods you want to eat or find new recipes you want to make and then go buy the stuff for it), we did include in the inventory a few things that are fermented or dehydrated or canned but that fill the role of being ingredients in other foods. Like, we do eat jam and I make a lot of jam (usually too much), but I don't use much jam in recipes or meal prep, so we didn't count it.</p>
      <h3>In the Pickle Fridge</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Fermented red pepper slices: 3 quarts</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Marinated sundried tomatoes: 2 quarts</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Kimchi (various kinds): 9 quarts</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Last year we ran out of all these things too soon, so I roughly doubled the amounts that I put up this year. We use the fermented red pepper slices a lot in salads and on pizzas. We eat kimchi as a side dish and also use it as an ingredient in things like fried rice and <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/kimchi-udon-with-scallions">kimchi udon</a>.</p>
      <h3>Canned items</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Spaghetti sauce: 4 pints + 2 quarts</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Salsa, 3 varieties: 15 quarts, 9 pint-and-a-half, 10 pints</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>"Ro-tel" (my home version): 6 pints</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Tomato sauce: 15 pints, 6 quarts</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Stewed tomatoes: 7 pints</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Crushed tomatoes: 18 pints, 5 quarts</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Soups, various types: 20 quarts, 21 pints</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Applesauce: 8 quarts, 2 pints</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>I've included soups in this category not because they're an "ingredient" but because they're a convenience meal. We eat them for lunches sometimes, in an unplanned and chaotic manner, but I often use them as a supplement to whatever I have planned for dinner or those "I'm too tired to cook tonight" dinners. We eat applesauce for dessert sometimes, but it's also an ingredient in some cakes and stuff that we really like so we included it here. One thing I can already tell is we need to can some pizza sauce next year (thicker than spaghetti sauce).</p>
      <p>I haven't included home-canned broth/stock in this list, although it is an ingredient and I do can it, because I can much more of it in the winter than I do in the summer. Summer canning is busy enough without also canning stock, which can be done at any time of year. So in March or April, I'll try to make sure I have enough stock to last through the summer built up before summer hits.</p>
      <p>This doesn't seem like much, given how much canning I do each summer, but that's because we only focused on a few narrow categories.</p>
      <h3>Fresh veg</h3>
      <ul>

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Parsnips: 4 buckets + 10 pounds</p>
        </li>

          <p>Radishes (watermelon, purple daikon): 2 buckets</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Beets: 2 buckets</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Carrots: 6 buckets</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Cabbage: 10 heads</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Napa cabbage: 20 small heads</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Potatoes: unsure exactly but in the neighborhood of 100 pounds, from different farms at different times</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Spaghetti squash: 20 count</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Pumpkins (some pie, some naked seed): 8 count</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Butternut squash: 5 count</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Squash, miscellaneous (kabocha, acorn, etc): 16 count</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The squash are sitting out on racks, not touching each other. Last year we wrapped all the spaghetti squash in newspaper and piled them into a crate together (the newspaper is meant to keep them from touching), but this year we have some stored like that and some on the racks with the other squashes, to see if the newspaper wrapping is essential to keeping spaghetti squash.</p>
      <p>The potatoes are stored unwashed in large wooden crates and protected from light.</p>
      <p>The apples (and also the Winterkeeper variety tomatoes, although we didn't count them as they were an experiment for us) are wrapped in newspaper and stored in a box.</p>
      <p>Onions and garlic are on racks like the squash, as is the cabbage; the leeks are as well, but this isn't ideal and it would be better next year to keep them in the garage refrigerator, I think.</p>
      <p>A lot of this was purchased in a bulk stock-up sale at the end of the growing season from <a href="https://harlequinproduce.csaware.com/store/?nh">Harlequin Organic Produce</a>. For the vegetables where we counted in "buckets" it's because we had already packed them into their damp-sand-filled buckets before doing the inventory. This represents something like 50 pounds of carrots and 10 pounds of beets and so forth.</p>
      <h3>UPDATE: February 2, 2021</h3>
      <p>The bucket of turnips went bad; we discovered this about a week ago. We're not sure why, whether turnips weren't meant to hold that long or the sand they were packed in was too dry or what. Anyway, so we lost a few pounds of turnips. I love turnips, so I am taking this hard. The radishes are keeping very well, though.</p>
      <p>The Napa cabbage goes bad much more quickly in that type of storage than the regular cabbage does, which isn't terribly surprising, but I think we had too much of it.</p>
      <p>The leeks in the root cellar are a little moldy on the outside but still totally fine on the inside. We're starting to run low now, but I think that's fine as we do still have some out in the garden that we can pull up on a day that the ground isn't frozen.</p>
      <p>I was a little hesitant to even buy, let alone store, red delicious apples because they are the epitome of the bland supermarket apple, but these have gotten tastier in storage. They are not very crisp at this point, so I am mostly using them in cooking, and they have good flavor.</p>
      <h3>UPDATE: March 7, 2021</h3>
      <p>The weather is threatening to turn warm enough that we can't keep our storage room at a consistently low temperature, so it's about time to finish getting through what's left down there. Today we made a quart and a half of sauerkraut to use up one of the cabbages.</p>
      <p>On the whole, the project has been pretty successful.</p>
      <p>Apples were just about the right amount, and they're holding up really well. Some of them got a little bit soft, but the flavor -- of Red Delicious apples, which are not the best tasting to begin with -- was actually better than eating them in the Fall.</p>
      <p>Our second major loss was one carrot bucket -- It seems that when one of these buckets goes bad, everything inside goes bad at once. The sand in this bucket seemed particularly wet, so we're suspecting that the problem on this one might have been due to overwetting when we packed them in.</p>
      <p>Some of the squash are starting to get mold, and we've lost a few. We lined some of the wire shelves with plastic, thinking it would cushion the squash and maybe prevent pressure points that would go bad first. Instead, it just seemed to have trapped moisture, and the bottoms of the squashes in contact with the plastic are what went bad first. Putting squash directly on wire shelves does not seem to be a problem, and in fact is probably the best way to go, to make sure that they get air circulation all around to keep the squashes dry.</p>
      <p>Radish, parsnips, and the carrots (apart from that one failure) are all still doing fine.</p>
      <p>Cabbages are all starting to show signs of age, but they're alright once you take 4-5 leaves off.</p>
      <p>What we ended up with way too much of: Parsnips and spaghetti squash. We either need to get less spaghetti squash next year, or make sure we cook them about once a week all Winter -- we certainly have enough spaghetti squash recipes that we like, so it won't be a hardship to eat more of it. We knew it was too many parsnips when we got them, it just happened by accident.</p>
      <p>Of Winter squashes, next year we probably want about five fewer than we got this year.</p>
      <p>Potatoes are holding up pretty well, but we still have a slightly unreasonable quantity.</p>

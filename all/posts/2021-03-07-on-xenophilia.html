			<h1>On Xenophilia</h1>
			<p>this thing food writers do where they worship even the most banal foods and restaurants as long as they are from a different country or from "people of color" (tamar adler, gabrille hamilton)</p>
			<p>the constant search for the new in food which might lead to kierkegaardian despair</p>
			<p>this has to do with authenticity but it's weird because in some sense there is no authentic american food, in this sense</p>

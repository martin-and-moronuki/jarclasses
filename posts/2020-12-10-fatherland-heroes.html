      <h1>Heroes of the Fatherland</h1>
      <p>Yesterday, we celebrated Heroes of the Fatherland Day (note: I'm not sure how we came up with this date, because the Wikipedia for this holiday gives the date of observance as 23 February, not 9 December, but regardless we found this date listed somewhere, and we celebrated), a day that is apparently intended to honor mostly military heroes of the Russian Federation and former Soviet Union. Honestly, we don't know that much about the holiday. We celebrated it for the first time, but perhaps not the last time, this year because it fell at a convenient time for a celebration for us.</p>
      <p>The particular circumstances are these: during the summer, I had fermented a watermelon and also vinegar-pickled a second watermelon. These preparations were following recipes that came from Linda Ziedrich's wonderful book, <a href="https://agardenerstable.com/lindas-books/">The Joy of Pickling</a>. The pickled watermelons are associated with <a href="https://agardenerstable.com/tag/fermented-watermelon/">German emigrants to Russia</a>, some of whom brought this culture to America with them when they came, especially in the Midwest. In the narratives around the recipes, she talks about how the fermented watermelons were special things, pulled out at family occasions, so I was looking for an event to use as an excuse to unveil the fermented watermelon in its stinky glory and maybe compare it to a jar of the canned pickled watermelon, too. In other words, a party. So, I asked my children to find a holiday of German or Russian significance in the month of December and we settled on this date for bringing out the watermelon with much pomp and ceremony.</p>
      <p>In truth, we didn't like the fermented watermelon that much, although I also think I did some things wrong with it. I think I didn't check the brine levels often enough to make sure that the melon stayed submerged properly, for one thing. But I had been warned about the sliminess of the finished product, which should have told me that I wouldn't like it too much. Sliminess is good in okra, but otherwise it's not a texture I love.</p>
      <p>The canned pickled watermelons, though, were better. They mainly taste like a sweet pickle, but you get just a hint of the watermelon flavor coming through. Not my favorite, and I doubt I will make them again, but not bad. When life gives me too many watermelons in the future, I think I will freeze the pureed pulp with a bit of sugar in it that can be thawed and turned into watermelon sherbet and sorbet throughout the year; that method of saving watermelons has never failed me.</p>
      <p>But literally everything else we ate for the great Feast of the Heroes of the Fatherland was excellent, so I wanted to share some of that. All the recipes I followed came from the cookbook <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Kachka-Russian-Bonnie-Frumkin-Morales/dp/1250087600/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=kachka&amp;qid=1612567314&amp;sr=8-1"><span class="title">Kachka</span></a>. The author makes it really clear that these are not <span style="font-style: italic">Russian</span> recipes, but whatever they are, they are delicious.</p>
      <p>The menu for the feast included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Marinated stone fruits, canned this summer. The canning process probably made them a little squishier than they are supposed to be, but nevertheless, they are completely delicious. The bay leaf flavor is unexpectedly good.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Vinegret salad</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Cabbage pirog, which my elder son decorated with a Soviet design. (we should put a picture here?) I only used half the pickled mustard seeds in it, because I was worried my younger son wouldn't like them, but next time I'll use them all. In the meantime, the leftover pickled mustard seeds are good on many other things, like sandwiches. This does use an extraordinary amount of butter but it's worth it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Siberian pelmeni. Lacking a pelmenitsa at the time, we made these by hand; we got all four of us working together on them, and the labor wasn't too bad, but these were delicious enough we decided to buy a pelmenitsa. Next time we make them, we'll be ready. I guess we did something wrong when making them because a) we had a lot of meat mixture leftover and b) it made many fewer than the recipe says it will. I'm not sure how to feel about the fact that the four of us ate every single one of these that night, zero leftovers. But they were so good, so juicy.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Strawberries and smetana. I had frozen the strawberries this summer, with some wild sweet woodruff in them. Strawberries that have been sliced at their peak of ripeness, marinated in a little sugar so they release their juices, flavored with a wild herb if you have it, and then frozen in those juices are an incredible thing, so good, so refreshing, such a relief from wintertime. I like winter, but some days, you need something that speaks of sunshine and warmth.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>All recipes are found in <span class="title">Kachka</span>.</p>
      <p>We did also break out a jar of <a href="https://valentinascorner.com/canned-zucchini/">Valentina's canned zucchini</a>. I think it was the first jar of this we had tasted (I canned it for the first time this summer), and we all liked it. The zucchini retains a good, firm texture, and the whole syrup gets flavored by the herbs <span class="emphatic">and</span> the tomatoes, making for a unique flavor. We will be canning this again next year.</p>
      <p>We ate that vinegret salad for many days afterwards, and the next time I make the recipe I will likely cut it in half. It makes like a gallon of salad. Good salad, and a salad that does keep reasonably well, but too much. In fairness, the recipe does say it feeds "8-10 as part of a larger <span style="font-style: italic">zakuski</span> spread," <span style="font-style: italic">zakuski</span> apparently being the Russian word for what I call "snack buffet."</p>
      <h2>Snack buffet nights</h2>
      <p>While we had this feast because of this particular circumstance, where I had this watermelon I wanted to give its proper due, we often have these themed "snack buffet" nights. It's a whole thing at our house. I think the first time we did it was because we wanted to play a game during dinnertime, so we needed a dinner that was reasonably easy to eat while also playing a board game. But now we do them, oh, on the order of once a month, I think, and they usually have a theme, often an international theme that we relate to some holiday or cultural tradition. Sometimes it's a good learning opportunity, and sometimes it is merely fun and delicious, although maybe simply eating the food of other cultures, as best you are able, is itself educational.</p>
      <p>Anyway, afterwards Chris and I were talking about it, and I told him how another reason I like to do this is because if I use a single cookbook for planning the menu, I can "get to know" that cookbook, and I often also end up learning something new about cooking. So, he asked me, what did you learn from this one?</p>
      <p>I picked maybe a weird thing to focus on, but: so many of the ingredients were grated, more than I'm used to. Things were seasoned simply; not a huge amount of spices or anything, and yet they were all very flavorful, and I think one reason is because grating ingredients, such as the onion in the meat filling for the pelmeni, amplifies the flavor and distributes it evenly throughout the dish, in a way that most chopping doesn't. But also, for example in the cabbage pirog, this is delicious not because of a ton of spices, but because the acidity is very perfectly balanced to highlight the flavors that are there, and the cabbage and mustard seed play off each other.</p>
      <p>It's easy, especially for a person who likes spicy foods and complex spice mixes such as curry, to think that that's what good cooking is about -- that a lot of spices is what it takes to flavor food. "Why don't white people put a pint of hot sauce on every dish they cook?" the internet memer asks.</p>
      <p>But the food we cooked last night was a refutation of the internet meme: simple food, properly seasoned, and a refreshing thing it is.</p>
